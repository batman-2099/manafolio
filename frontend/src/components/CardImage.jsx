// Every card image in the app. A drop-in for the plain <img src={card.image_url}>
// this replaced: className, style, loading, draggable and the rest pass straight
// through, so each call site keeps the sizing it already had.
//
// It exists because a missing image_url used to render as the browser's broken
// image icon — a torn page in the middle of an otherwise finished collection
// grid. Now there is always something card-shaped in the slot.
//
// Sources are tried in order, each one falling to the next when it errors:
//
//   1. contributed art  — somebody supplied art for this card, either on this
//                         instance or upstream in the repo. First because it is a
//                         deliberate act: if it exists, it is what was wanted,
//                         including as an override for provider art judged wrong.
//   2. provider art     — Scryfall, the normal case.
//   3. the card back    — drawn locally, so this step cannot itself fail.
//
// Step 3 is why onError chaining is used rather than a plain src: a URL that 404s
// or a CDN that is unreachable has to degrade the same way an absent one does.
